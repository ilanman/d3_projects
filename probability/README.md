This visualization generates paths of probability distributions from the [heatmap](http://bl.ocks.org/ilanman/9598445) example. It also uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) for styling.

Next iteration will include input from user to change mu (mean), sigma (standard deviation), lambda ([rate parameter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution) for an exponential, x_m and alpha for the pareto and alpha and beta for the gamma.
