This chart compares congressional workload over the years to the appropriations they are given. There is also the option of looking at the U.S. CPI over the same time to highlight the discrepancy. I am using [d3-tip](https://github.com/caged/d3-tip) for my tooltips. 
More context around this chart can be found on my [blog post](https://ilanthedataman.squarespace.com/understanding-the-data-game/?offset=1387897200000).
